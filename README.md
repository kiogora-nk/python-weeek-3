 Discount Calculator

This is a simple Python program that calculates the **final price of an item** after applying a discount.  
The program only applies the discount if it is **20% or higher**; otherwise, the original price is returned.

 Features
- Accepts user input for:

##  How It Works
1. The program defines a function `calculate_discount(price, discount_percent)`.
2. If `discount_percent >= 20`, the function reduces the price by that percentage.
3. Otherwise, the function returns the original price.
4. The user is prompted to enter:
   - The original price of an item
   - The discount percentage
5. The result (final price or original price) is printed.
